$.ajax() has a number of parameters

type: this is also known as the HTTP method, which will be GET in this case.

url: this is the URL to which the request is sent. We've sent it to the HelloAjax action in HomeController, which we still need to create. Another way of writing this would be url: '/Home/HelloAjax'.

success: this is a function that is called if the request is successful. It takes an argument result, which is whatever is returned from the request.

data :data, which is the data to be sent to the server.

add the action to the controller(HomeController.cs), which will be where the request is sent. the Action in this case is .'hello-ajax'

contentType: example using Json file /contentType says what kind of data we are sending to the server
dataType: says what type of data we expect back from the server
